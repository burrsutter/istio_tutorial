= Observing microservice meshes with Kiali

At some point when you are developing your microservice architecture, you will
need to visualize what is happening in your service mesh. You will have
questions like “Which service is connected to which other service?” and “How
much traffic goes to each microservice?” But because of the loosely tied nature
of microservice architectures , these questions can be difficult to answer.

Those are the kinds of question that Kiali has the ability to answer, by giving
you a big picture of the mesh, and showing the whole flow of your requests and
data.

== How does Kiali work?

Kiali taps into the data provided by Istio and OpenShift to generate its
visualizations. It fetches ingress data (such as request tracing with Jaeger),
the listing and data of the services, health indexes, and so on.

Kiali runs as a service together with Istio, and does not require any changes
to Istio or Openshift configuration (besides the ones required to install
Istio).

== How to install Kiali?

A prerequisite for installing Kiali is that you must have OpenShift and Istio
installed and configured.

Install Kiali with the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-configmap.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali-secrets.yaml | \
   VERSION_LABEL=master envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -

curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/deploy/openshift/kiali.yaml | \
   IMAGE_NAME=kiali/kiali \
   IMAGE_VERSION=latest \
   NAMESPACE=istio-system \
   VERSION_LABEL=master \
   VERBOSE_MODE=4 envsubst | oc create -n istio-system -f -
----

Installing Kiali may take a minute or two. You can use the following commands
to see if the service is running:

[source, bash]
----
oc project istio-system
oc get pods
----

You'll see a result that's something like this:

If the "STATUS" column for Kiali is "Running", you can check which URL it is
using by using this command:

[source, bash]
----
oc project istio-system
oc get routes
----

And you'll see a result that's something like this:

[source, bash]

So now we have the URL for Kiali (usually,
"kiali-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io"), so let's access it:

The default credentials are "admin/admin", but it's recommended to change them
before using it in production.

== Generating Sample Data

To show the capabilities of Kiali, you'll need an Istio-enabled application to
be running. On the Kiali repository there's a sample application called
Bookinfo that you can use to show these capabilities, and you can deploy it
like this:

[source, bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:kiali/kiali
cd kiali
./hack/istio/install-bookinfo-demo.sh
----

This will install the demo. Now we just need to visit it to generate data. We
can get the URL like this:

[source, bash]
----
oc project bookinfo
oc get routes
----

From there, we just visit the "productpage" service and this will connect to
all the other services on the demo.

== Service Graph

After you login, you should see the Service Graph page:

image::https://i.imgur.com/PtKVfe4.png[Service Graph Page]

It shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going
through then. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each
other.

== Service Listing

Click the Services link in the left navigation. On the Services page you can
view a listing of all the services that are running in the cluster, and
additional information about them, such as health status.

Click on a service name to view the Service Details page, where you can view
additional information about each service.

image::https://i.imgur.com/msQjCb4.png[Service Details]

You can see the health status of the service (a Healthy service means one that
is is up and responding correctly):

You can also see the deployments:

image::https://i.imgur.com/TdyjCOu.png[Deployments]

The source services:

And the virtual services on the Istio infrastructure:

image::https://i.imgur.com/mlZknRv.png[Virtual Services]

== Istio Config

Click the Istio Config link on the left navigation. On this page, you can see
all currently running config rules, such as Virtual Services, Route Rules,
Routes, Circuit Breakers, Fault Injection and so on.

== Distributed Tracing

Click on the Distributed Tracing link in the left navigation. On this page you
can see the distributed tracing, as provided by Jaeger.

== Cleanup (Uninstalling Kiali)

To uninstall Kiali from your cluster, run the following command:

[source, bash]
----
oc delete all,secrets,sa,templates,configmaps,deployments,clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,routerules --selector=app=kiali -n istio-system
----
